# UDP-Communication-App-Java-
This is a simple Java-based network application that demonstrates communication using the UDP protocol. The app acts either as a master or slave based on socket availability. Slaves send integer values to the master, which then processes them — summing or averaging — and can broadcast results. The project showcases basic concepts in network programming, datagram packet handling, and client-server interaction without relying on TCP connections.
